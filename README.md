# CircuitSolver
a java program that iterates to solve a MyOpenMath circuit problem. Could potentially solve any circuit problem...

this contains a runnable jar file that pops up with a promp to input values for a circuit.
the first two prompts query the user with information for the first two large circuit problems.
the second two prompts query for inputs for the problem with four lightbulbs.

In order to input correct values to the program,type in numbers seperated by commas without spaces.
For example: if queried for the voltage of the battery and resistances of the nine resistors,
input values that look like this: 18,145,225,65,95,245,115,210,140,70 : then click "Ok".
For the lightbulb problems, there would be only five values seperated by commas instead of ten.
